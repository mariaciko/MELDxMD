## MELDxMD protein-peptide binding

We want to predict binding modes using MELD-accelerated Molecular Dynamics, where MELD stands for Modeling Employing Limited Data. This approach accelerates conventional MD methods by integrating external information in a Bayesian framework. A common issue with physics-based approaches like MD are the kinetic traps conformations fall into in the potential energy surface. 

This project focuses on predicting the binding poses for P53-derived ligands to the MDM-2, X protein using MELDxMD via two methods: (i) predict binding in a competitive environment; and (ii) predict binding by solving the problem of steric hindrance. For (i), we follow the study of Morrone, J. A., Perez, A., MacCallum, J. & Dill, K. A. Computed Binding of Peptides to Proteins with MELD-Accelerated Molecular Dynamics. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 13, 870â€“876 (2017).
