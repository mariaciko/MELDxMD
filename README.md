## MELDxMD protein-peptide binding

We want to predict binding modes using MELD-accelerated Molecular Dynamics, where MELD stands for Modeling Employing Limited Data. This approach accelerates conventional MD methods by integrating external information in a Bayesian framework. A common issue with physics-based approaches like MD are the kinetic traps conformations fall into in the potential energy surface, resulting in a process that is slow and computationally expensive. 

This project focuses on predicting the binding poses for P53-derived ligands to the MDM-2, X protein using MELDxMD via two methods: (i) predict binding in a competitive environment; and (ii) predict binding by solving the problem of steric hindrance. For (i), we follow the study of Morrone, J. A., Perez, A., MacCallum, J. & Dill, K. A. Computed Binding of Peptides to Proteins with MELD-Accelerated Molecular Dynamics. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 13, 870â€“876 (2017).

MELD relies on a Bayesian framework to narrow its conformational search to only desired states (i.e. low-energy conformations). It implements "smart springs" or restraints that are not active indefinitely. This repository contains the preparatory files for the native structure 1YCR (MDM2-P53) and the reference peptide (P6W) for method (i) and (ii), in [single](https://github.com/mariaciko/Thesis/tree/main/single) and [double](https://github.com/mariaciko/Thesis/tree/main/double), respectively.
